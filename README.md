# Running-pipeline-of-notebooks-with-Kaggle-API

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to execute data pipelines on Kaggle using the Kaggle API and secrets management. The pipelines are designed for parallel execution, making the process efficient and scalable.

The pipex script streamlines the pipeline execution. It provides functions for:

  1.Pushing a notebook for execution.

  2.Monitoring its status until completion.

  3. Executing pipelines of notebooks sequentially or in parallel.
